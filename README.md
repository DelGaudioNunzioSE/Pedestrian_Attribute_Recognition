# Real-Time Video Analysis Pipeline 🎥🔍

## About this Repository 📚

Welcome to the repository for our university competition project! This challenge involves creating a complete pipeline for **real-time video analysis**. The main objectives of the project are:

- **Detecting people** 👥
- **Identifying attributes of individuals**, such as:
  - Gender 🧑👩
  - Whether they are wearing a hat or not 🎩❌
  - Whether they are carrying a backpack 🎒❌

## Rules and Requirements 🏁

We are allowed to utilize **pre-trained networks** for most of the pipeline. However, for the **classifier** responsible for identifying the attributes, we are required to train it ourselves using the datasets provided by [MIVIA PAR2023](https://mivia.unisa.it/par2023/).

## Goals 🥅

1. Design and implement a robust pipeline capable of analyzing video streams in real-time.
2. Accurately detect and classify the specified attributes.
3. Optimize the system for performance and reliability.

## Teamwork 🤝

This repository represents our collective effort to excel in the competition and showcase our skills in:
- Machine Learning 🧠
- Video Analysis 📹
- Software Engineering 💻

## Stay Tuned 🚀

Follow our progress as we develop the pipeline step by step. Your feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
